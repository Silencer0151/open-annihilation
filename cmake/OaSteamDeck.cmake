# oa-steam-artwork makes Steam's library pictures from the engine's icon in

# repository. oa-steam-deck-files, which only a build that names it runs,
# writes those pictures into steam-deck/artwork in the build tree and copies
# the files of platforms/linux/steam-deck beside them (the two Steam Input
# templates and the folder's README), giving the steam-deck folder that goes
# into the package next to open-annihilation.
