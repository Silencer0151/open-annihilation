# Installing on macOS

Open Annihilation runs on macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, on Intel and Apple
silicon Macs alike. No game data is included: you also need the game data
from your own copy of Total Annihilation, and step 3 shows how to get it on
a Mac.

## 1. Download Open Annihilation

1. Open the latest release on GitHub:
   [github.com/open-annihilation/open-annihilation/releases/latest](https://github.com/open-annihilation/open-annihilation/releases/latest).
2. Under **Assets**, download
   `open-annihilation-<version>-macos-universal.pkg`, the installer. The
   `open-annihilation-<version>-macos-universal.zip` beside it holds the same
   app without an installer.

## 2. Install it

- **With the installer:** double-click the `.pkg` and follow its steps. It
  puts **Open Annihilation.app** in your Applications folder.
- **With the zip:** double-click the `.zip` to unpack it, then drag
  **Open Annihilation.app** from the folder it makes into Applications.

The app and the installer are signed with a Developer ID and notarized by
Apple, so macOS opens them without a warning.

## 3. Get the game data

Open Annihilation needs the folder of an installed Total Annihilation with
the 3.1 update: the folder that holds `totala1.hpi`. Choose one of the ways
below.

### From GOG's Mac version

GOG sells **Total Annihilation: Commander Pack** with a macOS version, which
holds the game's folder inside its app.

1. Install GOG's Mac version of Total Annihilation, with GOG Galaxy or with
   GOG's installer.
2. In Finder, find the game's icon (in Applications), right-click it and
   choose **Show Package Contents**.
3. Open the **drive_c** folder, then **Program Files**, then **GOG.com**.
4. Copy the **Total Annihilation** folder somewhere convenient, for example
   your **Documents** folder. Hold **Option** while you drag it, so that
   Finder copies it and GOG's version keeps working.

### From a Windows PC

Copy the whole folder of an installed Total Annihilation, the one that
holds `totala1.hpi`, from the PC to the Mac, for example with a USB stick,
into your **Documents** folder. A copy from the original CDs must be
installed on Windows and updated to 3.1 first.

### The free demo

To try Open Annihilation without the full game, use the 1997 demo instead:
see [Playing the demo](../../README.md#playing-the-demo).

## 4. Start the game

1. Open **Open Annihilation** from Applications or Launchpad.
2. The first time, it asks for your Total Annihilation folder. Choose the
   folder from step 3. It remembers your choice.

To choose a different folder later, start it once from Terminal with
`--choose-game-dir`:

```sh
open -a "Open Annihilation" --args --choose-game-dir
```

Open Annihilation's own settings open from the **OA** button at the bottom
right of the main menu, or with **Cmd+,**. See
[Settings](../settings.md).

Double-click a `.oamod` file to install the mod it holds in Open
Annihilation ([mods](../mods/README.md#installing-a-oamod-file)).

With the macOS firewall on, the first time you host or join a multiplayer
game macOS asks whether Open Annihilation may accept incoming network
connections: click **Allow**. A firewall between the players must let
through UDP port 47624, which other computers use to find a hosted game,
TCP ports 2300 to 2400 and UDP ports 2350 to 2400.

## Where it keeps its files

Your saved games, screenshots, films and mods are in the **Open
Annihilation** folder in your Documents folder (`~/Documents/Open
Annihilation`):

| Folder | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `Saves` | saved games, a mod's in `Saves/<mod id>` and those without a mod in `Saves/default` |
| `Screenshots` | screenshots (Ctrl+F9) and posters (`MakePoster`), in a folder for each mod as in `Saves` |
| `Films` | films (Ctrl+F10), a `MOVIEnnn` folder each, in a folder for each mod as in `Saves` |
| `Mods` | mods you add, each in a folder of its own, which the settings' Mods page lists besides the game folder's `mods` folder ([mods](../mods/README.md#installing-a-mod)) |

The game makes each folder the first time it needs it. In the settings (the
**OA** button on the main menu), **Common Tweaks** shows the folder under
**Your files**, whose buttons open Saves, Screenshots and Mods in Finder.

**macOS asks first.** On macOS 10.15 and later, the first time the game
looks in Documents, which is at its first start, macOS asks whether "Open
Annihilation" may access files in your Documents folder. Click **Allow**
(**OK** on older versions). If you click **Don't Allow**, the game can
neither save games and screenshots there nor list your mods; to change your
mind, turn Open Annihilation on under System Settings › Privacy & Security ›
Files and Folders, or put the folder elsewhere (below). Started from
Terminal, as `run.sh` does, the game has the access Terminal has, and macOS
asks on Terminal's behalf.

Your settings, the log files (in `logs`) and the unpacked demo stay in
`~/Library/Application Support/net.coreprime.open-annihilation`.

**Saved games from earlier versions.** Versions before 0.7 kept saved games
in a `SAVEGAME` folder in `~/Library/Application
Support/net.coreprime.open-annihilation`, and a mod's in `mods/<mod
id>/SAVEGAME` there; 0.7.0 kept those without a mod in `Saves` itself. The
first start of a later version moves them into `Saves/default`, and a mod's
into `Saves/<mod id>`, once, and the main menu then says how many moved and
where, with a button that opens the folder. Nothing is overwritten: a saved
game whose name that folder holds already is moved as `NAME (2).SAV`,
keeping both. One
that cannot be moved stays where it is, and the game still lists it there.
The log says what moved and what did not. An earlier version started
afterwards no longer sees the saved games that moved.

**Putting the folder elsewhere.** Start the game with `--user-folder PATH`,
or add the key `open-annihilation.user-folder` with an absolute path to the
preferences file, and that folder takes the place of the Open Annihilation
folder in Documents. Saved games from earlier versions move only into the
folder the key or Documents names: a start with `--user-folder` leaves them
where they are and lists them there. With `--preferences-file`, the folder
is the **Open Annihilation** folder beside that file instead, and saved
games beside that file are not moved either: the game lists them where they
are. An Image Output Directory set in the game, with the console's `Film`
command, still takes the screenshots and films.

## Updating and removing

- **To update:** download the newer `.pkg` and install it over the old one,
  or replace the app with the newer one. Your settings are kept.
- **To remove:** drag **Open Annihilation.app** to the Trash. To remove your
  settings and logs too, delete the Application Support folder above; your
  saved games, screenshots, films and mods are in the Open Annihilation
  folder in Documents.
