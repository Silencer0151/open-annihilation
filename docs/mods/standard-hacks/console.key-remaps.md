## Description

The backslash key no longer repeats the last console line, leaving it free for the whiteboard. Insert repeats the last line instead, and F10 becomes a second key for toggling the debug keys.

## Configuration example

```yaml
hacks:
  console.key-remaps: true
```

## Details

### Behaviour

With the hack on:

- **Backslash** does nothing in the console; the key is left to other uses, such as drawing on the [whiteboard](ui.whiteboard.md).
- **Insert** re-runs the last console line, as backslash does in 3.1c.
- **F10** toggles the debug keys, as F11 does. Ctrl+F10 keeps its own meaning.

Both remapped keys still need the developer passphrase, exactly as the keys they stand in for. Without it, Insert and F10 do nothing.

### 3.1c behaviour

In 3.1c, after the developer passphrase, backslash re-runs the last console line and F11 toggles the debug keys. Insert and F10 alone do nothing.

### Network games

Keys act on the local machine only. The hack is part of the profile hash, so every machine has it on or off together.

### Interactions

- [ui.whiteboard](ui.whiteboard.md) draws while backslash is held; this hack keeps backslash from also repeating a console line.

### Implementation notes

- The app maps keys in `Runtime::handle_console_hotkey` (`src/app/runtime_console.cpp`). The console dispatcher turns Insert into the repeat key, F10 into F11 and backslash into no key in `key_acted_on` (`src/ui/console/src/debug_hotkeys.cpp`).
- `console_apply_rules` (`src/ui/console/src/commands.cpp`) copies the rules record field `rules.console.key_remaps.enabled` into `Console::key_remaps`.
- Tests: `ui-console` (`src/ui/console/tests/console_test.cpp`, `test_key_remaps`: both keys need the passphrase, Insert repeats, F10 toggles, backslash does nothing; without the hack Insert and F10 do nothing).
