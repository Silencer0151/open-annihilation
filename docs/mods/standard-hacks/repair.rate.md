## Description

Builders repair damaged units at a speed that grows with the builder's
`WorkerTime` and the target's `MaxDamage` and `BuildTime`, instead of 3.1c's
single hit point per repair step. In the default mode the fraction of a hit
point left over by each step is kept, so slow repairs lose nothing to rounding.

## Configuration example

Switch it on with the exact mode:

```yaml
hacks:
  repair.rate: true
```

Scale the repair with worker time, but round each step's heal and energy up
to at least 1 instead of carrying the remainder:

```yaml
hacks:
  repair.rate: clamp-min-1   # shorthand for {mode: clamp-min-1}
```

## Details

### Behaviour

A repair step runs on each tick a builder repairs a damaged unit. Its work is
`w = WorkerTime / 30`. A target at full health, or one without a type, takes
no step in any mode.

The first two modes start from the same two amounts, each computed at 53-bit
precision and truncated:

- health: `(MaxDamage × w − 1) / BuildTime + 1`
- energy: `(BuildCostEnergy × w − 1) / BuildTime + 1`

`mode` then chooses what is paid and healed:

- `clamp-max-1` (3.1c): each amount is at most 1. A step pays at most 1
  energy and heals at most 1 hit point, whatever the builder's worker time.
- `clamp-min-1`: each amount is at least 1, so a fast builder heals and pays
  in proportion. Under both clamp modes a target with a `BuildTime` of 0
  leaves both amounts at 0.
- `exact-remainder`:
  - The energy is the amount above, at least 1. When the economy refuses it,
    nothing is healed and the step has not happened.
  - The heal is `trunc(w) × MaxDamage / BuildTime`, with integer division.
    The division's remainder is added to what the builder carries for this
    target; each time the carried amount reaches `BuildTime`, `BuildTime` is
    taken off it and the step heals 1 more.
  - A builder carries remainders for its two latest targets. A third target
    takes the first entry's place and starts with nothing carried. An entry
    stays with its unit slot when the unit dies.
  - A builder that carries no remainders (unit index 0, or outside the table)
    heals 1 more whenever the division leaves a remainder, and at least 1.
  - A builder with `WorkerTime` below 30 (`trunc(w)` is 0) pays the energy
    and heals nothing. A step that pays and heals nothing has still happened.
  - A target whose `BuildTime` is 0 or negative is not repaired.
  - One step heals at most 65535 hit points.

The heal is applied as a healing damage event (kind 10). When another machine
simulates the target, the heal is sent to that machine as in 3.1c.

Self-repair from `HealTime` runs through the same step, so this hack also
decides how much a regenerating unit heals: see
[repair.healtime-self-heal](repair.healtime-self-heal.md).

### Baseline

3.1c repairs 1 hit point for at most 1 energy per step: `clamp-max-1`.

### Network games

The machine that simulates the repairing unit runs the step. `mode` is part
of the profile hash, so every machine plays the same rule. Under
`exact-remainder` the carried remainders are game state: they are folded into
the match-state digest that machines compare, and a saved game keeps them.

### Implementation notes

- The step is `recover_health` in `src/sim/unit-health/src/unit_health.cpp`,
  with `recover_health_exactly` for `exact-remainder`. It reads
  `rules().repair.rate.mode` (the `RepairRate` record in
  `src/data/match-rules/include/oa/data/match_rules/records.inc`).
- The remainders live in `Match::repair_remainders`, two entries per unit
  slot, allocated by `Match::keep_repair_remainders` in
  `src/sim/match-runtime/src/tick_host_health.cpp` only under
  `exact-remainder`. They are the rule-state table `repair-remainders`.
- Tests: `unit-health-repair-rate`
  (`src/sim/unit-health/tests/repair_rate_test.cpp`) covers each mode, the
  edges, a builder without a table and the two-target limit;
  `match-veterancy-repair` repairs in a match and checks the remainders as
  rule state; `data-match-rules` and `data-mod-profile` check the record and
  the profile parsing.

## Full configuration schema

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: schema -->
Hack id `repair.rate`, written under the profile's `hacks` block.

| Write | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `repair.rate: true` | On, every parameter at its default. |
| `repair.rate: {mode: exact-remainder}` | On, the parameters named set and the rest at their defaults. |
| `repair.rate: {preset: baseline}` | On, starting from a preset; parameters named beside `preset` replace its values. |
| `repair.rate: exact-remainder` | On, the shorthand: a bare value sets `mode`. |
| `repair.rate: false` | Off, the same as leaving it out: 3.1c behaviour. |

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Unit | Allowed | Length | Baseline (3.1c) | Default | Adjustable | Scope | Overridden by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `enum` | - | `clamp-max-1`, `clamp-min-1`, `exact-remainder` | - | `clamp-max-1` | `exact-remainder` | `fixed` | `sim` | - |

Adjustable: `fixed`: only the profile sets it.

### Presets

| Preset | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline` | `{mode: clamp-max-1}` |

`baseline` sets every parameter to its 3.1c value: the hack is on and plays as 3.1c.

### Shorthand

The hack has one parameter, so a bare value sets `mode`: `repair.rate: exact-remainder` is `repair.rate: {mode: exact-remainder}`.

### Every parameter at its default

```yaml
hacks:
  repair.rate:
    mode: exact-remainder
```
