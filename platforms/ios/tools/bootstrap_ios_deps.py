"""Build the pinned SDL3 and FreeType as static libraries for iPhone and iPad.

The iOS and iPadOS build (platforms/ios) links them into the game. Each
system image (SDK) gets its own prefix root, <deps>/ios-<sdk>, with one
install prefix per library (sdl/, freetype/): iphonesimulator for the
simulator on this Mac, iphoneos for devices. Both are built for arm64 and
run from iOS 15.0. The sources are the engine's pins: the SDL release
tools/bootstrap_sdl.py names and the FreeType release and options
tools/bootstrap_text_fonts.py names, from the same verified archives in
<deps>. zlib comes with the system image, and the fonts are the host's
(local/deps/text-fonts), which are the same on every platform.

Build trees live beside each root (<root>-build). Each prefix records in
build-settings.json what its library was built from and how: the version,
the archive's SHA-256, the system image and its version, the deployment
target, the architecture and the options, and for SDL the patches applied
to it (tools/sdl-patches), each by its SHA-256 and name. A library whose
prefix is complete and records the settings of this run is not built again;
any other is built afresh, so an SDL built before its release had patches,
or with a patch that has changed since, is built again from the patched
source. Nothing outside the archive cache, the roots and their build trees
is modified.

--self-test checks, in a scratch folder, which SDL prefixes a run reuses
and which it builds again, and that SDL's settings name the patches of
tools/sdl-patches. It builds and downloads nothing, needs no Xcode tools
and runs on any system. Exit status: 0 when the libraries are ready (or
the self-test passed); 1 when the self-test fails.
