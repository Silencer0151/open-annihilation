// The automation endpoint's input: the events of an input request become
// SDL events pushed onto SDL's event queue at the frame's pump, which the
// main loop's next poll hands to the game as it hands a device's; the
// request is answered at the next frame's pump, once they have been taken.
// The keys and buttons the events hold down are held for the game's reads
// of what is held (the automation host's hold_key and hold_buttons), and
// let go when the client leaves.
