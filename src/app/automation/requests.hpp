// What the automation endpoint answers: one table of the protocol's
// operations, each with the handler that answers it, and one of the work
// the endpoint does each time it is served, after it has taken requests,
// such as answering a request a handler holds. A new operation adds a row
// to the first table; work that follows a request over later frames adds a
// row to the second.
