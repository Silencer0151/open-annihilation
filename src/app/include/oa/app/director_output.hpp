// The files a director script's render writes (docs/director.md), and the

//
// A render of a script named NAME.oascript writes, in its output directory:
//
//   NAME-000.mp4 ...    each chunk's video with its sound, when encoding is on
//   NAME-000.wav ...    each chunk's sound: 16-bit stereo PCM at 48 kHz
//   NAME-000.frames ... each chunk's frames, one "<frame> <tick> <sha256>" line
//                       a frame, the frame's RGB bytes hashed
//   NAME.mp4            the chunks joined, when every chunk was rendered and
//                       encoding is on
//   NAME.manifest       what was rendered and the hashes of every chunk's
//                       frames and sound, when every chunk was rendered
//
// While they are needed, each chunk's encoded frames (NAME-000.video.mp4),
// the chunks' sound joined (NAME.wav) and the list of chunks to join
// (NAME.concat.txt) are kept beside them too; they are removed once the
// render is done, and a render that stops on an error leaves them.
//
// Chunk numbers have at least chunk_number_digits digits. The encoder is the
// ffmpeg program: each chunk's frames go as raw RGB through a pipe to it,
// which makes H.264 (libx264, High profile, 4:2:0, BT.709, constant quality
// 18, closed groups of half a second of frames); the chunk's sound is then
// joined to them as AAC at 48 kHz and 384 kbit/s. The joined video copies the
// chunks' frames and encodes the joined sound once. Setting the environment
// variable director_encoder_variable to director_encoder_off renders and
// hashes every frame and writes every file but the videos, running no
// encoder.
