// How a match is presented while a director script renders it or the
// generator analyses it (Runtime's director members): the frame it draws and
// where its sounds go.
//
// In director mode the match is drawn at the output size from the camera the
// director sets, never the player's: the battlefield fills the frame unless
// the interface is asked for, no cursor is drawn, and nothing on the wall
// clock reaches the frame. Debris particles start once a tick whether or not
// the tick is drawn, so a pass that draws and one that does not play out the
// same. Every sound the match plays, every player's unit announcements
// included, goes to the sound hooks, placed from the director's camera,
// instead of to a sound device.
