/// Draws a picture into a rectangle of a target as SDL's software renderer
/// draws a texture LINEAR, so that a check can hold that renderer's
/// read-back to it exactly: along each axis the picture is stepped through
/// in 16.16 fixed point, a step being its texels over the rectangle's
/// pixels, truncated, and the first sample half a step, rounded, less half
/// a texel in; each pixel weighs the two texels around its sample in
/// 128ths of a texel toward the second, rows first and then columns, and
/// the sum is truncated once; and a sample before the first texel's
/// centre, or beyond the last pair, takes the edge texel. SDL draws so on
/// processors with SSE2 or NEON; a build of SDL without either truncates
/// after each pass, which can give one level less. With a factor above 1
/// the picture is first enlarged that many times by nearest replication,
/// as the NEAREST pass of sharp-bilinear into its prescale target does.
/// Pixels of the rectangle outside the target are left out.

/// @param factor texels of the enlargement per picture texel, at least 1
/// @param rectangle where the picture lands, in the target's whole pixels
