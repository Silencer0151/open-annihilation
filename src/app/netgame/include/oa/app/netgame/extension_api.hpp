// Network play's API for the engine extensions that build on it: 3.1c's
// launch block, which the game switches and a launching extension write;
// applying and ending a launch; the application mode the next frontend pass
// sets; leaving the game; the lines posted to a launched battle; and the
// hooks through which such an extension adds to network play (the match
// report a network game keeps, the console's Page, a join the launch asked
// for that failed). An extension that links oa-app-netgame-sdk builds on network play:
// the engine lists it after network play's extension, so where the engine
// calls every extension in turn network play's hook runs first, and where
// it asks the extension built on the others first, that extension answers
// before network play. Every function is called on the thread that runs
// main(); none throws.
