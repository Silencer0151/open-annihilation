// What the battlefield shows between two ticks. A frame drawn a fraction of
// the way from one tick to the next shows each unit's place, heading and
// script-moved pieces, each projectile's flight and each debris piece's fall
// that fraction of the way from the tick before to the current tick, never
// past it. "The tick before" is the last tick the presentation saw before the
// current one: the tick before it, or, when one frame's clock step ran a
// batch of ticks (above normal speed), the tick before the batch. The poses
// of the tick before are copies the presentation takes as it sees each tick;
// a draw between ticks works on copies of the unit records and model
// instances, and never writes the match's own. The debug grid's random
// numbers are kept from a tick's first draw for its later draws.
