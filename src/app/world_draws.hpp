// The battlefield's draws of one frame, in the order they draw, so that the
// frame can be drawn in horizontal bands. The drawing thread works the list
// out first (Runtime::render_match_surface): everything drawing builds or
// changes on the way is done then, once, in the draws' order: the piece
// transforms, the units' cached images and silhouettes, the texture
// animations, the projectiles' models, the GAF frames decoded for the
// particles. Each band then draws the whole list with its own rows of the
// frame alone (draw_world_band), reading the list and the models and
// writing only its rows of the frame and of the model bridge, so that the
// bands give the frame drawn whole byte for byte, one after another or at
// the same time. A large explosion file is drawn a frame at a time: each of
// its frames is rendered from the file's bytes as it is drawn, through a
// cache of rendered frames with a budget of bytes (GafFrameCache).
