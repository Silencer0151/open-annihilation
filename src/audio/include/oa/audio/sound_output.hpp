// The sound output every sound of the game plays through: effects, speech,
// music and the movies' sound. A stream takes samples in its own format and
// rate; the output converts and mixes the streams and plays them on the
// system's sound device. Two outputs exist: SDL's, wherever the game uses
// SDL, and a mixer of the engine's own over the Windows wave-out device,
// for systems SDL does not run on.
