// The streamed zip reader: an archive read a piece at a time through a hook,
// however large, as a mod package (.oamod) is. It reads the central
// directory, the 64-bit extension included, then each entry's data in fixed
// pieces, inflating deflated data through a fixed window and checking each
// entry's size and CRC-32 as it ends. Nothing it holds grows with an entry's
// size: about 44 KiB of decoder state and two 64 KiB buffers for an open
// entry, and the directory, bounded by StreamLimits.
//
// It refuses what the in-memory reader refuses (oa/formats/zip.hpp), apart
// from the 64-bit extension, which it reads, and adds: 64-bit records that
// are missing or disagree with the others, a directory larger than its
// limit, entries whose data overlaps another entry's or the directory, and
// names marked UTF-8 that are not. Names not marked UTF-8 are read as code
// page 437, the format's own default, and the backslashes of an entry made
// on MS-DOS or Windows become '/'. Links and special files are marked, not
// refused: the caller decides.
