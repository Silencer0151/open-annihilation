// The director's camera: views of the battlefield, their limits on a map,
// the engine camera that draws a view, and a script's shots compiled into
// the camera of every video frame.
//
// A view is a centre on the ground plane and the height of the map it
// shows, in map pixels (oascript.hpp). It is drawn at zoom = output height /
// view height, and it never shows past the map: its height lies between
// min_view_height and the height at which the whole map fits the output
// (fit_height), and its centre keeps it within the map's bounds, the game's
// Game.map_pixel_width by Game.map_pixel_height.
//
// Shot s runs from its tick to the next shot's tick (the last to the end
// tick); its frames are those that show its ticks, and game time is never
// skipped. Each shot moves three quantities from a start to an end: the
// centre's x and z, and 1 / height, in which zoom changes evenly. Its start
// is its cameraStart, or for a shot without one the state the shot before
// reaches at its end, its speed included. With frames k = 0 .. n - 1 and
// the end state at k = n:
//
//   linear  value(k) = start + (end - start) k / n, at the constant speed
//           (end - start) framerate / n
//   spring  value(0) = start, speed 0 (or the carried speed); each later
//           frame first sets speed += dt (w^2 (end - value) - 2 d w speed)
//           and then value += dt speed, with dt = 1 / framerate,
//           w = 2 pi frequency and d the damping ratio
//
// A transition of m frames covers the first m frames of its shot, which draw
// the tick twice: once from the shot's own camera and once from the view the
// shot before reached at its end, held still (transition.hpp blends them).
// Sounds are always placed by the shot's own camera.
//
// The views every frame shows are computed with addition, subtraction,
// multiplication, division and square root of doubles, conversions and
// floor, in the order written here and nothing else, so that every
// platform computes the same frames. Clamping to the map applies to each
// frame's view, never to the moving state.
