// Plans a director script from a replayed game's timeline. The planner
// knows the whole game before it places the first shot, so the camera can
// arrive where something is about to happen.
//
// The camera follows the game's moments: the whole map settling onto the
// first commander; in the quiet parts of the game, turns of each player's
// side in order, turn_side_shots turns a side, each a commander and what it
// builds, a factory finishing its first units, a construction unit
// expanding the base or the base itself, framed at varied heights and
// drifting or pushing in slowly for 6 to 14 seconds, longer when the
// subject starts something, and now and then a wide drift from one side to
// the other; armed groups that are advancing on an enemy base, weighed by
// their value; where the most damage lands in the next seconds, weighted
// by what it destroys and held while the battle goes on; now and then
// long-range fire, framed wide from launch to impact, or a gun firing and
// its shell landing, cut to one after the other; a commander dying, a
// nuclear blast or another large one interrupting the shot; and the
// commander death that decides the game, held, then a pull back.
//
// Shots last min_shot_ticks to max_shot_ticks with at least min_cut_ticks
// between cuts; a new subject must score switch_ratio times the current
// one; a subject is never taken twice in a row, and a subject whose view
// overlaps a view left in the last memory_ticks scores less the more it
// overlaps and the more recently that view was left; units the viewer's
// view does not draw, and commanders under the sea, are never framed;
// subjects stay in the middle of the frame (safe_area_percent), placed
// within it so that the view shows as little water as it can, and a fight
// at sea scores less; the camera follows its subject only once it nears
// the edge of the view, a bounded step at a time; and zoom changes at most
// max_zoom_change_percent a second between follow shots.
//
// Near subjects are panned to (a quiet turn's only when the camera shows
// its middle already), and a view whose middle the one before shows, or
// that shows the middle of the one before, is cut to; so are a gun firing
// and its shell landing; other cuts dissolve, a cut to the other side of
// the map after wipe_spacing_ticks without a wipe wipes, a big moment
// comes in with a checkerboard, and the first action of the game and the
// ending fade through black.
//
// The planner uses integer arithmetic alone, so the same timeline gives the
// same script, byte for byte, on every platform.
