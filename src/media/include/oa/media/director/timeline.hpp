// types were, every unit created, finished, shooting, hit and killed, where
// the mobile units were every sample_period_ticks ticks and how every player
// stood every stats_period_ticks ticks.
//
// Everything is an integer read from the world as the replay ran, so the
// same recording gives the same timeline on every platform. Positions are
// whole map pixels of the world point (x across, y up, z down the map); the
// map-image row a point is drawn on is z - y / 2 (ground_row).
