// The system socket driver for the DirectPlay engine: a TCP listener and
// outbound connections for stream messages, one UDP socket for datagrams,
// and (while hosting) the UDP enumeration port. Everything is non-blocking;
// connection buffers are fixed-size and a peer that overflows them or sends
// a malformed stream header is disconnected.
//
// A datagram to 255.255.255.255 is a search of the local networks: it goes
// out as the directed broadcast of every local IPv4 network, which reaches
// a game hosted on this machine too. Only when no directed broadcast could
// be sent does it go to 255.255.255.255 itself and as a copy to this
// machine.
//
// Unless an advertised address is configured, every message header carries
// this machine's address on the way to its destination, as a DirectPlay
// sender writes it: the bind address when one is set, else the address the
// system routes the destination through, and on a search each network's
// own interface address.
