# Render probe

What the game can learn about the renderer SDL made and the graphics adapter
behind it. Target `oa-platform-render-probe`, header
`oa/platform/render_probe.hpp`, namespace `oa::platform::render_probe`.
It is built only where SDL is, and links SDL privately; its public header
only declares `SDL_Renderer`.

## Entry points

- `describe(renderer, read)` returns `AdapterFacts`: SDL's name for the
  render driver and the video driver, the texture limit SDL reports, and,
  with `AdapterRead::read`, the adapter: its name, its
  vendor string and PCI identifiers where the interface gives them, its
  software flag, the device's own texture limit, and whether the game runs
  under Wine. With `AdapterRead::skip` only SDL's properties are read, as
  for a start whose `SDL_RENDER_DRIVER` names the driver. SDL's software
  renderer has no adapter (`AdapterState::none`); an adapter that its
  interface would not name, or a renderer this build has no reader for,
  is `AdapterState::unknown`. `describe_reported(renderer, video_driver,
  reported_texture_limit, read, reader)` is the same from SDL's names and
  report, with the adapter read through a hook (`AdapterReader`): the part
  of `describe` a test can drive without a graphics interface.
- `names_software_rasteriser(name, vendor, device)`: true for a name that
  holds, in any letter case, `llvmpipe`, `softpipe`, `lavapipe`, `swrast`,
  `software rasterizer`, `swiftshader`, `gdi generic`, `apple software
  renderer`, `microsoft basic render driver`, `virtualbox`, `vmware`,
  `svga3d` or `chromium`, and for vendor 0x1414 with device 0x008C (the
  Microsoft Basic Render Driver, which WARP reports). Mesa's drivers layered
  over a software rasteriser (zink, virgl, its Direct3D 12 driver over WARP)
  carry the rasteriser's name in their own. `names_virtual_adapter` is the
  part of the list that names a virtual machine's adapter, and
  `vendor_names_virtual_adapter` matches the OpenGL vendor string, for
  `humper` alone (VirtualBox's older OpenGL pass-through).
- `reports_fixed_texture_limit(renderer)`: true for `vulkan` and `gpu`,
  for which SDL reports a fixed 16384 rather than the device's own limit.
  The probe keeps both limits as reported and read; the app's render policy
  corrects them (`texture_limit` in
  [render_policy.hpp](../../app/include/oa/app/render_policy.hpp)): a
  report of 0 means no limit (SDL's software renderer sets none), and on
  these two drivers the device's own limit is taken where it was read, and
  otherwise the report at most 8192.
- `adapter_needed(renderer)`: true for `direct3d12`, `vulkan` and `gpu`,
  on which an adapter that cannot be read leaves the renderer not capable,
  since a software rasteriser cannot be ruled out there.
- `capable_before_vista(renderer)`: true only for `direct3d`, SDL's
  Direct3D 9 renderer, the one driver that may draw through the graphics
  card on Windows before Vista; any other there keeps the standard tier.
- `accelerated_tier_run(renderer)`: true for the one driver the
  accelerated tier has been run on with this build's system and processor
  architecture, `metal` on 64-bit ARM macOS and `direct3d11` on x86 and
  x64 Windows; every other class is one nobody has run, which the render
  policy starts at the lowest budget. `untried_arm_processor()` is true in
  an ARM build for any system but macOS.
- `classify(facts)` fills `software_rasteriser` (SDL's software renderer,
  the interface's software flag, a software rasteriser's name or WARP's
  identifiers) and `virtual_adapter` (a virtual machine's adapter by name or
  vendor string); `software_or_virtual(facts)` adds Wine, under which every
  renderer draws through Wine's own translation.
- `clean_name(name)` turns control characters into spaces, trims the ends
  and cuts a name at 255 bytes without splitting a character.
- `native_window_framebuffer(video_driver)`: true for the `windows`, `x11`,
  `dummy` and `offscreen` video drivers, in any letter case, whose windows
  have a framebuffer of their own that SDL's software renderer presents
  through with no graphics driver; elsewhere, as on `cocoa`, `wayland` and
  `kmsdrm`, SDL presents it through a texture of a hardware render driver,
  which the framebuffer hint names.

## How each interface is read

Which readers exist is chosen per system at compile time; inside them
everything is found at run time. Nothing links a graphics library: each
reader reaches its interface through the object SDL made for the renderer
(its properties) or through a function looked up at run time, so one
Windows package still starts on every Windows release from XP, and Linux
needs no Vulkan library to start.

| Renderer | Systems | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `direct3d` | Windows | The device's creation parameters, its `IDirect3D9`, and `GetAdapterIdentifier` of that adapter with flags 0, the cheap form |
| `direct3d11` | Windows | The device's `IDXGIDevice`, its adapter, and `IDXGIAdapter1::GetDesc1` (name, identifiers, `DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE`), or `GetDesc` where the adapter is older |
| `direct3d12` | Windows, where the toolchain has `d3d12.h` and `dxgi1_4.h` | The swap chain's `IDXGIFactory4`, `EnumAdapterByLuid` with the device's adapter identifier, and `GetDesc1` |
| `opengl`, `opengles2` | every system | `glGetString` for the renderer and vendor strings, looked up with `SDL_GL_GetProcAddress`, and only while SDL's context is current |
| `vulkan` | Windows, Linux | `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties` through SDL's `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and the renderer's instance: the name, identifiers, CPU device type and largest 2D image side, from a head of the structure declared here |
| `metal` | Apple | The name of the Metal layer's device, by Objective-C messages |
| `gpu` | SDL 3.4 and later | The name of SDL's graphics device; on SDL 3.2 the adapter is unknown |

The interface identifiers the Windows reader asks for are defined in its
source. Wine is found by `GetProcAddress` of `wine_get_version` in
`ntdll.dll`, which every Windows process has loaded.

## Who uses it

Start-up describes the renderer it made and logs one line, with the
texture limit the render policy corrects and the tier the first frame is
drawn in, and the +stats overlay names the driver and adapter
([src/app](../../app/README.md)). The walk of the render drivers that makes
it asks `native_window_framebuffer` what to set the framebuffer hint to
before SDL's software renderer. The render policy reads what the probe
found (`adapter_needed`, `capable_before_vista`, the classification, the
corrected limit) to tell whether the renderer can be accelerated, and `accelerated_tier_run` and
`untried_arm_processor` for the rung it starts at.

## Tests

`platform-render-probe` checks the name tables over names real drivers
give, in any letter case, and real cards' names against them; WARP's
identifiers; the drivers that report a fixed texture limit or need their
adapter read, the one driver that may be accelerated on Windows before
Vista, and the class the accelerated tier has been run on; the
classification and the cleaning of names; what `describe_reported` reads
through a stand-in reader, for SDL's software renderer and for others,
with the adapter read or skipped, named, failing or blank; the video
drivers whose windows have a framebuffer of their own; and SDL's software
renderer on the dummy video driver described.

The readers of the graphics interfaces themselves have no automated test:
the checks run on the dummy video driver, where SDL makes only its software
renderer. They were checked by hand on a Mac, where the Metal, OpenGL and
`gpu` renderers each named the Apple GPU, the start-up line capped `gpu`'s
limit at 8192 and a skipped read left the adapter empty.

## Known limitations

- It does not yet report a Direct3D 9 device's lost state, or an OpenGL
  out-of-memory error.
- The test does not yet read its own executable's imports on Windows to show
  that no graphics library is linked; list a Windows build's imports to
  check it.
- The Windows readers have been compiled only by the cross-compiled
  Windows build (x86-64), not yet by the compiler of the Windows build CI
  makes. The Direct3D 12 read calls `ID3D12Device::GetAdapterLuid`, whose
  returned structure each toolchain's headers declare in their own way;
  build the module with that compiler before relying on it there.
