// Lifetime contract:
// - The library owns its texture archives, every PreparedModel and the
//   animation cursors inside them. `cursors` points into those entries.
// - It never owns a model. Each entry holds a weak reference to the handle it
//   was prepared from, so a model dies with its last owning handle. Handles
//   must own their model; an aliasing handle into storage that can move or be
//   reused is not supported.
// - prepare_model returns a model's entry to any handle that reaches it
//   while the model it was prepared for is alive. When that model has been
//   freed and another allocated at its address, the old entry and its cursors
//   are erased and the new model is prepared afresh; find_prepared_model
//   reports no entry for it until then.
// - release_expired_models erases every entry whose model has been freed,
//   with its cursors, so dead models stop stepping.
// - A caller keeps a model alive for as long as it uses the model's entry;
//   the entry stays valid while its model lives and the library exists. Its
//   frames and sequences point into `textures`, which must not be replaced
//   while entries exist.
