// Enhanced anti-aliasing of units: each unit's model, and its shadow, drawn
// at a whole number of samples along each axis of a game pixel into samples
// of its own and reduced into the frame, each frame pixel blending the
// average of the samples the unit covers with what lies under it by that
// coverage, so that the unit's edges are smoothed. The unit's cached image
// is kept at the same number of samples and built again exactly when the
// game's image is. Terrain, sprites, the fog and the interface are drawn as
// they are. At UnitSupersampling::off a unit draws exactly as without the
// setting. Presentation only: nothing the simulation reads changes.
