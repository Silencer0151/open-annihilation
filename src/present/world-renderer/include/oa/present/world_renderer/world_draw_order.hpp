// The order the battlefield draws its features and units in. The map is
// drawn far to near in rows one plot deep. Features lower than
// standing_feature_min_height (rubble, metal heaps) lie under every unit and
// draw first. Then each row draws its ground units followed by the standing
// features (trees, rocks, wrecks) whose plot is in that row, so a tree covers
// the units in its own row and the rows behind it, and the units in the rows
// in front of it cover the tree. Aircraft and units off the ground draw last,
// after the projectiles and explosions, over everything on the ground.
