// Playback of a TA Demo recording (.tad) through the match's own network
// receive path. The third-party recorder kept every datagram the recording
// client sent or received, minus the condenser envelope and the frame
// sequence dword, stored unit-state (0x2c) records without their tick behind
// a tick base, and kept each player's lobby block as sent. Playback rebuilds
// each recorded packet as a broadcast frame from its sender and offers it to
// the packet layer as a transport would once the local tick reaches the
// sender ticks it carries, so frame ordering, tick spreading, admission and
// record dispatch run exactly as for a live peer. The local machine is a
// watcher slot with no units; every recorded player is a remote slot, under
// its recorded id, whose units arrive through 0x09 and 0x2c records.
