// Read-only hooks that report what happens in a match: units created and
// finished, shots placed, shots detonating, damage and deaths. The match
// calls them (Match::event_hooks) at the points every such event passes
// through, whoever simulates the unit: this machine, or a recording the
// match replays. A hook reads the world it is given and nothing else: it
// never writes match state, draws from the match's random streams or calls
// back into the match, so a match with event hooks plays out exactly as one
// without.
