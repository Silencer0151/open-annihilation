# Weapon execution

`tick_weapons` runs a unit's three weapon slots each tick. It counts reloads
down in the unit's canonical `UnitWeapon.reload`, resolves each target through
the host, starts the `AimPrimary`, `AimSecondary` or `AimTertiary` script of a
turret or vertical-launch slot, applies the reach test, runs the typed
projectile-constructor boundary, and does the game's bookkeeping after a
successful shot.

The reach test receives the unit position; the ballistic reach test keeps its
own preliminary range, water and height gates. Non-stockpile slots compare the
shot cost with the owner's stores (`can_pay_shot_cost`) before the projectile
constructor, reporting `insufficient_resources` and firing nothing when either
falls short, and pay the cost (`pay_shot_cost`) only after the constructor
fired. The turret constructor waits until the Aim script it started has returned
nonzero (`UnitWeapon.aim_ready`) and the aim is within tolerance; turret and
vertical-launch shots clear the aim bit, so the slot aims again before the next
shot. Projectile construction stays host-owned because
`WeaponDef.fire_callback` selects different constructors. A successful
`fire_projectile` must also dispatch the corresponding COB `FireWeapon`
callback before it returns true. Returning success without a projectile and
callback is not a supported integration.

`weapon_launch.hpp` holds the launch, flight and impact arithmetic of the
constructors: bearings, launch speeds and expiry, ballistic lift, accuracy
spread, veteran lead, burst children, guidance steering, damage scaling and the
area blast bookkeeping.

## Interceptors, map contact and retaliation

`interceptor.hpp` covers the interceptor target search, the vertical-launch
constructor with its Aim-script wait and interceptor gate, the Aim return
callback, projectile record initialisation and the guided aim point (including
the cruise descent). `projectile_contact.hpp` covers the per-tick map-cell
contact test: the intercept burst, ground and air occupants, the plot feature,
ground bounce and the water surface. `retaliation.hpp` covers a damaged unit's
reaction to its attacker: the attack-order attempt, weapon-slot re-aiming over
the ballistics reach test, the computer-player alert and the under-attack
notice. All three work on the canonical `World` records; order queues, category
masks, explosions, scripts and the records shared with other players stay with
the caller through plain hooks. `projectile_pool.hpp` covers the pool
allocator, retirement, compaction and the cancelling of a dead unit's burst
spawners. The match runtime flies its projectiles through the pool, contact and
interceptor code; `projectile_plot_contact` takes the plot fields directly
because the match's plots are not canonical yet. The match's damage path runs
retaliation.
