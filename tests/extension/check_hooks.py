"""Check that open-annihilation calls the hooks of its extension tables.

Runs an open-annihilation built with the recorder test extensions
(-DOA_RECORD_EXTENSION_HOOKS=ON), which the game lists after network play's
extension, and reads the counts each run leaves in its --record-hooks file.
Every run must record at least the calls RUNS lists for it; a hook recorded
with an enumerator ("frame pump") names that call only. The follower, the
extension built on the recorder, counts its own calls as "follower.<hook>":
across the runs of a set it must be called for every hook the recorder is
called for, but the Runtime member only the recorder has, and at each point
where the combined table calls the two in a set order it counts
"follower.order <hook>" when the order held and "follower.misordered <hook>"
when it did not, which fails the run. --runs picks the runs:

  options  the option hooks, without game data: --help, the -r switch
           (whose refusal is network play's), an unknown option, a game
           directory that does not exist and a follower that fills
           frontend_game beside network play, which stops the start;
  game     the rest, over the installation OA_GAME_DIR names: a headless
           skirmish, the headless --check-navigation run (whose speed keys
           reach speed_changed and whose menus app_mode_set), a headless run
           the recorder takes to drive the check host without a window
           (--record-check-host), and interactive main menu frames,
           --check-multiplayer-menu (network play's walk of the multiplayer
           screens, after which the recorder drives a round of the main menu
           through the check host), --check-match-dialogs
           (whose close requests reach close_requested and whose GAME slider
           speed_changed), a --generate-script run whose recording no
           extension replays (open_recording) and a run the recorder ends through
           ScreenServices::quit (--record-quit) with status 3, through SDL's
           dummy drivers. When OA_GAME_DIR is unset,
           empty or names no directory it exits with --skip-code
           (OA_GAME_DATA_SKIP_CODE), which ctest reports as skipped, or fails
           when OA_REQUIRE_GAME_DATA=1.

HOOKS must name the hooks src/app/include/oa/app/extension.hpp declares, in its order.
With every run of both sets, each of them is reached except those UNREACHED
lists, which only a shared match or a run these sets do not make reaches,
and those NETWORK_PLAY_ONLY lists, which one extension at most may fill and
network play fills, so neither test extension does; so are match_event's
left, results_reported and watching_kept, which these runs do not ask for.
A new hook must be added to the recorder and the follower (or, when one
extension at most may fill it and network play does, to
NETWORK_PLAY_ONLY), to HOOKS and to a run here or to UNREACHED.
