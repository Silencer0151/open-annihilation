"""Build the pinned zlib, SDL3 and FreeType as universal static libraries for macOS.

The macOS release (tools/release_macos.sh) links them into the application,
which then needs no library beyond the system's. Each library runs on arm64
and x86_64 Macs from the oldest macOS release --deployment-target names, and
gets its own install prefix (zlib/, sdl/, freetype/) under the prefix root,
<deps>/macos-<deployment target> unless --prefix-root names another. Each
library is built for both architectures at once. Build trees live beside
the root (<root>-build). Each
prefix records in build-settings.json what its library was built from and
how: the version, the archive's SHA-256, the deployment target, the
architectures and the options, and for SDL the patches applied to it
(tools/sdl-patches), each by its SHA-256 and name. A library whose prefix
is complete and records the settings of this run is not built again; any
other is built afresh, so a new pin, a new or changed patch or new options
never leave older libraries in place: an SDL built before its release had
patches records none, and is built again from the patched source.
Nothing outside the cache, the root and its build trees is modified.

--self-test checks, in a scratch folder, which SDL prefixes a run reuses
and which it builds again, and that SDL's settings name the patches of
tools/sdl-patches. It builds and downloads nothing, and runs on any
system. Exit status: 0 when the libraries are ready (or the self-test
passed); 1 when the self-test fails.
