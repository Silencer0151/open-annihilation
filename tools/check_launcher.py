"""Check the launcher's argument forwarding, installation choice and failed-build
protection without game assets.

run.sh passes --game-dir from its option or OA_GAME_DIR and nothing else, so
without either the game uses the remembered folder or asks; it starts the file
the oa-game target builds, open-annihilation, never an older build's oa-game,
and on macOS the executable inside the application bundle open-annihilation.app;
--movie plays from the chosen installation's Data folder; a failed configure
or build stops it before anything launches.
