"""Check that the engine keeps its layout: modules, links, layers, names and graphics links.

A module is a directory under src/ whose CMakeLists.txt defines targets
(src/<group>/<module>, or src/<group> itself for a group-level module such
as src/core); its group is the first directory under src/. The check reads
the build files and sources under --root and the targets a configuration
defined (--targets, written by cmake/OaLayout.cmake), and fails on:

  reach        a build file that names a directory outside its own with ..
               (add_subdirectory, an include directory or a source), or a
               target's include directory or source in another module
  foreign      a target linked from another directory's CMakeLists.txt,
               whether the configuration made the link or a build file
               under src/ names it in a branch this platform does not take
               (target_link_libraries of a target another directory's
               build file adds)
  include      an #include that leaves its module by a relative path, a
               public header's relative #include of a file outside its
               module's include/ (which the targets that export the header
               do not carry), or an #include that names another module's
               header when no link of the including target (or of the
               header's own target) reaches a target that exports it
  layer        a link from a module library to a library of a later layer
               (the order is core; base; platform and formats, which may
               not use each other; data; sim, which may not use platform;
               present, audio and media; ui, netgame and session; app),
               unless
               tools/layout-baseline.json lists it
  stale        a baseline entry for a link that no longer exists, which
               must be removed: the baseline may only shrink
  name         a module library not named oa-<group>-<module>[-part]
               (oa-<group>[-part] in a group-level module); any library of
               the tree (the build files at the root and under cmake/, src/
               and tests/, every platform's branch included) not named
               oa-<group>[-<part>] or without the ALIAS
               oa::<group>[::<part>], the part's hyphens as underscores; or
               a public header outside include/oa/<group>/<module>/ and
               include/oa/<group>/<module>.* (include/oa/<group>/ in a
               group-level module)
  graphics     a target of the tree, test or tool included, that links a
               graphics API: a library or framework GRAPHICS_LIBRARIES
               names (d3d9, d3d11, d3d12, dxgi, opengl32, vulkan-1, GL,
               EGL, vulkan, Metal, QuartzCore and the like), by name, as
               -l<name> or -l:<file>, as a file or framework path, or as
               one of the OpenGL:: and Vulkan:: imported targets. It is
               found where the configuration made the link, where any
               build file at the root or under cmake/, src/ and tests/
               makes it, in any branch (calls over several lines,
               generator expressions, the variables the build files and
               CMake's OpenGL and Vulkan packages set, link options and
               target and directory link properties included), and where
               a source under src/, tests/ or tools/ asks the linker for
               it outside a comment (comment(lib, ...) or
               comment(linker, "/DEFAULTLIB:...")). A variable a link
               names is read with every value any build file gives it, in
               any function or scope, so a link's variable needs a name of
               its own. The engine reaches a graphics API only at run
               time, through the objects SDL made or the system loader,
               so that no package imports one; what SDL's own target
               brings with it is SDL's and is not read

Tests (executables) and tools may link anything, but must still link what
they include, and link no graphics API. Code outside src/ is not checked,
apart from the names of its libraries and its graphics links.

--self-test checks a small built-in tree. Exit status is 1 on any finding
and 2 when the targets file or the baseline cannot be read.
