"""Check the automation endpoint of a running game, end to end.

The game runs through its main loop on the dummy SDL drivers, started with
--fark and --fark-file. The check reads the address and token from the file,
which only its owner may read, and then, over 127.0.0.1:

- a connection that speaks no frames is closed unanswered, and so is one
  whose first frame is larger than a hello may be;
- a hello with a wrong token is answered denied, and the connection closed;
- a hello with the token is answered with the protocol's and the engine's
  versions, the window's size and the canvas's place in it;
- while that client is connected, a second one is answered busy;
- screen names the main menu; prefs gives the preferences file and the
  values it held, all of them or those named; an unknown operation and a
  request without an op are refused;
- controls names the main menu's SINGLE, MULTI and EXIT buttons with their
  places on the canvas and in the window; input that expects another
  screen is refused screen_changed and pushes nothing, events that cannot
  be read are refused bad_request, and a click on SINGLE through the event
  queue is answered once the game has taken it and opens Single Player;
- Load Game, with no saved games, stacks its message box over its dialog:
  screen lists msgbox before loadgame, and controls the box's OK first;
  OK closes the box and Cancel the dialog;
- a client that sends hello and quit at once and then ends its side of the
  connection has both answered, and the game ends with status 0.

The log says where the endpoint serves and never holds the token.
