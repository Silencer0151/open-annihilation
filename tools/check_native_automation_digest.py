"""Check that the automation endpoint leaves a running match as it is.

The game first records a network game of its own: its in-process loopback
check (--net-loopback-check) plays one headless over 127.0.0.1 and
--net-record keeps it. That recording is then played back as the first
scene of the game's main loop, on SDL's dummy drivers, twice, with the
same seed and for the same number of frames, each run writing the match's
per-tick trace stream (--trace-digest):

- once without --fark;
- once with --fark, and a client that subscribes to every kind of event and
  asks screen, match with its saved-state digest (state_hash), room and
  prefs at every frame until the run ends.

The two trace streams must be the same, byte for byte, over the ticks both
runs reached, which must be at least MIN_TICKS: the endpoint, its events
and the digests it works out change nothing of the simulation. The client
must be told the screen shown as it subscribes, number its events from 1
without a gap, and see the match running, its players named and its digest
given, at MIN_MATCH_FRAMES frames at least.
