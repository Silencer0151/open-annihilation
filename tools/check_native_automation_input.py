"""Check input through the automation endpoint of a running game, end to end.

The game runs through its main loop on the dummy SDL drivers, started with
--fark, as check_native_automation.py starts it, and is driven only by the
endpoint's input, which reaches it through SDL's event queue:

- input requests sent far faster than the game takes them, one a frame, are
  held back: the game reads no more of them than about a frame's worth
  while they wait, so the sender stalls long before it has sent
  FLOOD_BYTES and the game's memory stays within FLOOD_GROWTH_BYTES (not
  judged with --sanitized: a build with the address sanitizer keeps the
  memory it frees in a quarantine of its own);
- MULTI on the main menu opens the providers, whose list names TCP/IP; a
  double click on its row, placed from the list's rows in the window's
  pixels, opens the TCP/IP dialog, with its address field focused and holding the
  stored address;
- keys and the text they type, End, BackSpace over the stored address and a
  new one, reach the field: it then holds the new address;
- Cancel and Previous Menu return to the main menu, and Single Player,
  Skirmish and Start begin a skirmish;
- in the match the camera stays still, scrolls right while the endpoint
  holds the right arrow key down, as the game reads a held key, and stops
  once the key is let go, and once a client that left holding it is gone;
- F2 opens the game menu; in Save Game the name field holds the name typed,
  OK saves the match under it, and Load Game lists it, selected; Cancel and
  Resume go back to the match;
- quit there asks the surrender question, and its Yes ends the game with
  status 0.
