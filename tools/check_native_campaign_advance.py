"""Check that a headless run with --give-orders wins Arm mission 1 and goes on.

AC01 is won when any of the player's units comes within 64 of the Galactic
Gate (MoveUnitToRadius). --give-orders sends the player's armed units there,
so a headless run from fresh preferences must reach victory, then go through
the end screen and the next briefing into AC02 as a player pressing Start
would, and keep playing it, without a failed tick. AC02 counts its own
ticks from its start: its unit counts begin at tick 0 and its orders come
every 300 of them. --snapshot must write the two briefings, and between
them AC01's last frame, with its outcome's title, and its end screen.

Both briefings are drawn over ARM's background (bitmaps/mbriefarm.pcx, read
through --tool), every pixel in a colour of its palette, the planet and the
panorama as much as the gadgets. Their text is in ARM's colours: the rows in
palette entry 53 and the MORE... caption in 51, and AC01's "*PRIORITY
CRITICAL*" in the yellow of the highlights, 64, as it shows before its first
flash (the headless clock stands still).
