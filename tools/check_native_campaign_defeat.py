"""Check that Arm Campaign mission 9 (AC09) at medium is lost with its commander.

The medium schema starts the player with the commander and a Galactic Gate and
sends two Pyros at the commander from the first seconds ("w 2,a ARMCOM"
and "a ARMCOM"). Left idle, the commander burns down and the gate goes in its
death blast, so a headless run from fresh preferences must end in defeat
without a failed tick. The game tests the local outcome every 30 ticks and
lets a defeat stand only when a countdown of 4 runs out below zero, five tests
later: the defeat lands 150 to 180 ticks after the commander's death.
