"""Check that winning the demo's last Arm mission leaves its end screen for the ending.

open-annihilation starts on the folder holding the installer of the Total
Annihilation demo (1997) that the OA_DEMO_INSTALLER environment variable
names, with --data-dir on a scratch folder, as native-demo-installer starts
it. It runs the Arm Campaign's last mission (--mission, counted from 0; AC03
in the demo, won in about 2300 ticks) headless with --give-orders at easy,
from preferences that set nothing else. The mission must be won without a
failed tick, and the end screen after it must leave for the ending instead
of offering a next mission, though the demo holds no outcome0 bitmap for its
panel; with movies off the ending goes to the main menu.

Without OA_DEMO_INSTALLER the check prints one line and exits with 77, which
ctest reports as skipped.
