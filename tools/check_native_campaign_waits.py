"""Check that a campaign's scripted factories wait out their 'w' seconds.

Core Contingency mission 6 (EXP1CC06) at medium opens with both computer
factories under script: the hover plant "w 100,b ARMMH 2,..." and the
aircraft plant "w 200,b ARMBRAWL 2,...". The game multiplies a 'w' by 30.0,
so the Wait orders last 3000 and 6000 ticks. A script clears unit flag 0x20,
which keeps the unit out of the computer player's squad sort until its
MakeSelectable, and the computer player gives no factory a pick while it
holds an order. So the computer
side makes nothing until the hover plant's wait ends, its first unit then
starts on the plant's pad, and the aircraft plant is still waiting when the
run stops.
