"""Check that the game plays the Total Annihilation demo (1997) from the folder holding its installer.

The installer the OA_DEMO_INSTALLER environment variable names stays where it
is. The game, open-annihilation, starts headless with --game-dir on its folder
and --data-dir on a scratch folder. The first start must unpack the archive to
demo-1997/TADemo.hpi in the scratch folder, check it and mount it, and the
verifier (oa-demo-installer-test --verify) must then find the file's size and
SHA-256 to be those of the release the engine recognises. A second start must
check the archive and mount it without unpacking it again, and one after the
archive was damaged must unpack it again. The installer's folder must be left
as it was.

Each start runs --skip-intro --frames 60 on the dummy SDL drivers and must
reach the main menu: it ends with status 0 and its "native check:" lines,
which count the gadgets of the open screen and name it, must show the main
menu open with no dialog over it, such as a disc prompt or a message box.

With --check NAME it runs one of the game's own checks over the demo instead,
started the same way on a fresh scratch folder: navigation
(--check-navigation, which over data with no skirmish map walks the notices,
the grayed-out entries and the campaign's way in and out), saved-games
(--check-load-save, which over data with no save and load dialog checks that
every entry to it is grayed out), multiplayer-menu
(--check-multiplayer-menu, whose MULTI shows the notice for data with no
multiplayer map) or render-tiers (--check-render-tiers with --force-capable
on SDL's software renderer, which switches the accelerated presentation on
over the main menu and the demo's first Arm mission, since the demo has no
skirmish map). Each must end with status 0 and print the line its check
prints when it passes; a check that skips, as render-tiers does on a machine
under 2 GiB of memory, ends with 77 and the demo check skips with it.

Without OA_DEMO_INSTALLER the check prints one line and exits with 77, which
ctest reports as skipped.
