"""Play the Total Annihilation demo's (1997) missions and a save inside each.

open-annihilation starts on the folder holding the installer that the
OA_DEMO_INSTALLER environment variable names, with --data-dir on a scratch
folder, as native-demo-installer starts it, headless on SDL's dummy drivers
and from fresh preferences. --check picks what it runs:

  mission   the Arm Campaign mission --mission names (counted from 0) starts
            from its briefing with units on both sides and plays
            MISSION_TICKS ticks, or up to its outcome, without a failed
            tick;
  saveload  each demo mission saved at SAVE_TICK loads back into the same
            tick, units, world digest and orders, and the same counts of
            normal, 3D and animating features and of the features playing
            a burn, die or reclamate sequence, with no state dropped either
            way, and, loaded again with none dropped, plays RESUME_TICKS
            ticks on.

Without OA_DEMO_INSTALLER the check prints one line and exits with 77, which
ctest reports as skipped.
