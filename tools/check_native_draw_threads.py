"""Check that the drawing threads never change a frame.

The seeded headless skirmish is drawn frame by frame (--frame-rate) on one
drawing thread and on several (--draw-threads):

- its armies starting to fight with the camera's scroll held, at zoom 1,
  zoomed in and zoomed out: the terrain fill and the fog split their rows
  into bands by the data alone;
- a longer fight with --busy-combat, into its explosions, debris, shatter
  fragments and smoke, with missile trucks firing, a kbot lab building
  peewees in a spray of nano particles, an air transport loading a peewee
  and the local army selected with its selection boxes shown, at zoom 1
  with enhanced anti-aliasing off and at 4x: the battlefield's units,
  features and effects are drawn in one band of rows for each drawing
  thread, each band drawing every draw of the frame with its own rows
  alone.

Every run of a view must print the same frames digest, a digest of every
frame's drawn battlefield, and the same world digest; and each run must say
it drew on the threads it was given, and in as many bands at zoom 1 (where
every tile row can start one) and in at least two elsewhere. (The frame's
conversion for the window, which a headless run does not make, is checked
by app-xrgb-conversion.)
