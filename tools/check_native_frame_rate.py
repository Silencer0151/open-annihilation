"""Check the headless skirmish drawn frame by frame (--frame-rate).

The same seeded skirmish, its local army marching south, played through the
match clock and drawn every frame at 30, 60, 120 and 144 frames a second
must write the same trace stream, tick for tick, and reach the same world
digest: how many frames are drawn, and how far between two ticks each is
drawn, never changes the match. At 30 frames a second, the tick rate, there
must be a frame for each tick, each showing its tick whole; at the higher
rates at least half the frames are drawn between two ticks.

A run at 120 frames a second that sweeps the camera's scroll over the
marching army writes a frame log, in which the camera must move the same
distance every frame, and each frame must show a quarter of a tick more than
the one before. The check prints the motion from frame to frame of the
ground (the camera), against the whole clock units the camera stepped by
before, and of the unit the log follows over the ground, as the simulation
holds it, which moves once a tick (as every frame drew it before), and as
drawn, and on the screen. The unit as drawn must move on nearly every frame,
and no frame may carry more than half the most it moves in a tick: no step
at the tick rate.

A run at 120 frames a second whose camera tracks the marching unit (--follow)
writes a second frame log, in which the unit must be drawn at the same whole
pixel of the screen on every frame: the camera is placed where the frame
shows the unit, after the frame's clock step, so the ground moves under it
and the unit never jumps by a tick's step. The check prints the spread the
unit had on the screen when the camera was centred before the clock step on
the tick's place and the view moved by the unit's step since.

Runs at 30 and 120 frames a second whose clock starts 2 seconds before
2^32 milliseconds (--frame-clock), where the match clock's reading turns over
to 0, must write the same trace stream and reach the same world digest as
the runs from 0, the match stepping on through the turn: at 30 frames a
second every frame runs a tick but the first past the turn, which runs none,
and at 120 no more than one tick's frames are added.
