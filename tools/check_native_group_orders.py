"""Check that a group moved to one point keeps its shape, as the game's group order does.

A headless skirmish is staged with a block of nine fighters and a row of
eight infantry kbots of the local player, each group then moved to one
point as a selection of it is. Every unit's own destination follows from
where the group stood: its centre is the average of the units' whole map
pixels, truncated toward zero, and a unit within sqrt(3000 * N) map pixels
of it is sent to the point moved by its displacement from the centre,
while one further away is sent to the point itself.

As the run ends, the fighters, all within that reach of their block's
centre, must have landed each on its own destination, the block's shape
moved to the point, on nine sites no two of whose footprints share a cell.
The kbots of the row within reach of its centre must stand at their own
destinations, a kbot whose move has finished on its destination's cell,
and the two at the ends of the row, out of reach, must have gone to the
point.
