"""Check a join whose host is not found, end to end, as the game plays it.

A launched joiner waits on the game list for its host's game; when none is
listed in time, a joiner whose launch is still active is told so by the
extension that launched it and goes back to the main menu, and any other is
told "Host not found.  Exiting..." and, 4 seconds later, leaves the game and
ends the program with exit status 0, showing the local player's disconnect
reason first when there is one. A launch is still active when the wait
begins in every game launched, so only --check-host-not-found, which counts
its "-n1" launch as active until the wait begins, reaches the second
outcome.

open-annihilation runs through its main loop on the dummy SDL drivers with
"-n1:127.0.0.1", which opens multiplayer at once over TCP/IP and joins that
address. The game asks for games at a DirectPlay port of the check's own
(--dplay-port), which the check holds open and never answers, so no game is
found there whatever else runs on this machine. The run must end by itself with status 0 after reporting the text
and a leave about 4 seconds later with no reason and exit status 0.
