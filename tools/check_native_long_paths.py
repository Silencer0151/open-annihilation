"""Check that the game plays from folders deeper than its own path fields.

The game's own records hold paths in fields of 256 bytes, and the Image
Output Directory it starts with is the game folder followed by the user's
name, so a deep install or a long user name once stopped the game at start.
The game now keeps such paths whole. It starts headless on the dummy SDL
drivers, from a scratch game folder that links to every entry of the
installation --game-dir names, with its preferences file (and so the saved
games and pictures kept beside it) and an empty mod folder (--mod-dir) in
folders as deep, and USER and USERNAME set to a name of USER_NAME_LENGTH
characters:

- at DEEP_LENGTH characters, more than the game's fields hold;
- where the system says how long a path it opens (1,023 bytes on macOS,
  4,095 on Linux), at that length less MARGIN, which leaves room for the
  names inside each folder.

At each depth the game must open the main menu, and a headless skirmish
must save its world at SAVE_TICK into the saved-games folder beside the
preferences file and load it back with the same tick, units and digest.

Where the scratch folder can link to the installation's files neither by
symbolic links nor, for files, by hard links, or the system cannot make a
folder DEEP_LENGTH characters deep, the check prints one line and exits
with 77, which ctest reports as skipped.
