"""Check that the installation offers its movies without its Data folder.

The rules for game data with no movies, which gray out INTRO, hide Credits
and end a won campaign with a notice instead of the ending movies, belong to
data such as the Total Annihilation demo (1997). An installation of the game
keeps its movies' menu entries and ending whether or not its Data folder
holds the movies, since its game disc's archives are there.

The game starts headless twice, with --skip-intro --frames 60 on the dummy
SDL drivers: once on the installation --game-dir names, and once on a scratch
folder that links to everything in it but its Data folder. Both must end
with status 0, say that the game offers movies, and draw the same main menu,
byte for byte.

Where the scratch folder cannot link to the installation's files, the check
prints one line and exits with 77, which ctest reports as skipped.
