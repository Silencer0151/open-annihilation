"""Check hosting and joining a network game from the command line, end to end.

Each game runs as a program of its own through its main loop on the dummy SDL
drivers, over 127.0.0.1, at a DirectPlay port of the check's own
(--dplay-port), so the check runs beside anything else on this machine:

- a host started with --host, --player-name and --game-name reaches its
  battle room;
- a joiner started with --join and --player-name joins it: both battle rooms
  list both players by the names given;
- with a game hosted with --game-password, a joiner that sends the wrong
  password is refused with the notice the game list shows ("You did not have
  the correct password"), and one that sends the right password and names
  the game with --game-name joins it.

The joiners' preferences hold a TCP/IP address and a player's name of their
own, which the run must leave as they were.
