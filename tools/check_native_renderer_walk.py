"""Check the walk of SDL's render drivers in the game's log.

The game starts three times with --skip-intro --mute --frames 1 on the dummy
SDL drivers, which have no graphics device, so that every hardware render
driver refuses and only SDL's software renderer starts:

- with SDL_RENDER_DRIVER unset the game walks SDL's drivers in SDL's order
  (app-render-host checks the order against SDL's own list). Every driver
  tried before the software renderer must refuse and be logged once,
  as "open-annihilation: graphics: renderer <driver> refused: <reason>"
  with a reason, before the start-up line, which must name the software
  renderer on the dummy video driver; the software renderer must not be
  refused, and no second walk is logged, since no driver is recorded as
  failed. The start must end with status 0;
- with SDL_RENDER_DRIVER=software the start is SDL's own call, with no
  walk: no refusal is logged, the start-up line is, and the start ends with
  status 0;
- with SDL_RENDER_DRIVER naming a driver that does not exist the start
  fails as it always has: status 1, the error
  "open-annihilation: SDL_CreateRenderer: <reason>", no refusal logged and
  no start-up line.
