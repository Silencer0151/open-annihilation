"""Save a headless skirmish at a tick, load it back and compare world digests.

Run A fights COMBAT_UNITS units a side beside the commanders, with a factory
queue, a building, a patrol, a guard and a move given, for SAVE_TICK ticks and
saves at that tick, so its closing digest is the world the save captured. An
Atlas picks a unit up onto its link piece and is flying it off at the save,
and a transport ship holds units that started aboard. Two ticks before the
save a tree catches fire, one feature starts its die sequence, another its
reclamate sequence and a fourth is cleared away, so the save holds them while
they play. Run B starts from the save without stepping and must print the
same tick, unit count, digest, orders and saved features. Run C resumes the
save for RESUME_TICKS ticks to show the loaded match keeps simulating and
keeps those orders, the transports still carrying their units.

The digest covers each unit's record, economy, weapons, COB script state,
movement state and saved orders, the map's metal, placing-player and sight
words, the camera and the meteor state, and every run must report that the
save wrote and the load restored all script, movement, economy and order
state. The saved features are compared as the Features section writes them:
the counts of normal, 3D and animating records, the animating ones playing a
burn, die or reclamate sequence, and a digest of the section, leaving out the
features on plots a load hides under the map's edges, which do not come back.
The digest names each feature type by its name, since a load orders the
feature type table its own way.

Two campaign missions then check carried units across a save and a load: one
where an Atlas starts with a unit aboard, on a map whose schema places
feature types beyond the map's own, one where Bears and transport ships start
loaded. Each is saved at CARRIED_SAVE_TICK and loaded back, and must come back
with the same unit digest, which covers each unit's carrier, its piece (none
for a unit in the hold, which is not drawn) and its attacker, the same orders,
BeCarried among them, and the same saved features.

Saves load at the unit limit they were saved with, Summary "maxunits", which
every run prints with the match's setting and the run-wide limit. Run A's
save is edited three ways: without the field it loads at the run-wide limit;
at OTHER_UNIT_LIMIT it builds its world at that limit and holds the same
world, and the save the game then writes holds that limit and loads back
into the same world, which keeps simulating at it; at a limit no unit pool
can hold it is refused. Each campaign save, edited to
CAMPAIGN_SAVE_UNIT_LIMIT, still plays at its mission's limit and the same
world, and only the run-wide limit takes the save's. A skirmish started with
the Unit limit setting at SETTING_UNIT_LIMIT plays at it, and its save loads
at it into the same world in a run whose setting is the default, and keeps
simulating at it.
