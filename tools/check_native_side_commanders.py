"""Check sides that name commanders and HUD art of their own.

Each player's commander is the type its side names in SIDEDATA, whatever its
name and whatever its unit file says. A side's HUD panels come from the GAF
its SIDEDATA intgaf names, and its resource bars from its own SIDEn section.

A scratch mod folder over the installation gives SIDE0 (ARM) the commander
CAPTAIN and SIDE1 (CORE) the commander MARSHAL: copies of the installation's
commanders under those names, without the Commander and ShowPlayerName keys
or the commander category, each with its build pages and SIDEDATA build
list. Each side's bars take colours of their own. A third side, SIDE2, is
ARM's section under another name, with CORE's panels (intgaf=CORINT) and
bar colours of its own. Over it:

- A headless skirmish of the local player on each of the three sides draws
  its side's panels: the top and bottom bars match the installation's own
  ARM HUD on SIDE0 and its CORE HUD on SIDE1 and SIDE2, outside the resource
  bars, which are filled in the colours of the player's own section.
- With the commander rule "game ends", the stage gives the computer player
  three more units and then kills its commander through the console. The
  commander's death takes every unit of its player with it, and the local
  player wins. With the rule "game continues", the same stage leaves the
  three units standing, and nobody wins. Left alone, the computer player
  builds with its commander.
- The network loopback check with a computer player finds each player's
  commander on both machines.
- In the network loopback check without one, the host's player gives every
  unit it has, its commander among them, through SHARE.GUI. Only a type in
  the Commander category stays with the giver, so CAPTAIN goes with the
  rest; the joiner's player gives it back, and both machines agree.
- The navigation check, whose player records check reads each side's
  commander, passes.

Each skirmish must start with one commander for each player, of its side's
type, and no other, end with status 0 and report no simulation error.
