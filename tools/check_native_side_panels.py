"""Check that each side draws the panels its intgaf names and the font it names.

A side's HUD panels (PANELTOP, PANELSIDE and PANELBOT) come from the GAF in
anims/ that its SIDEDATA intgaf names, and its resource numbers and unit panel
are drawn in the font in fonts/ that its font key names; a side without a font
key draws them in COMIX, and places its right-aligned and centred labels as
though they had no width. A scratch mod folder over the installation holds:

- SIDEBINT.GAF, the installation's CORINT.GAF with every pixel of PANELTOP
  drawn in one palette colour, which SIDE1 (CORE) names as its intgaf;
- SIDECFNT.FNT, a copy of the installation's HATT14.FNT;
- SIDE2, SIDE3 and SIDE4, SIDE0's section (ARM) under other names: SIDE2 with
  font=SIDECFNT, SIDE3 without a font key and SIDE4 with font=COMIX.

Over it, the local player plays a headless skirmish on each of the five
sides, against side 1 (side 0 when it plays side 1 itself), and the
snapshots of the HUD at 640x480 show:

- on SIDE0 the top and bottom bars match those of the same skirmish without
  the mod folder;
- on SIDE1 the top bar is drawn in SIDEBINT's colour, not in CORINT's;
- on SIDE2 the bars keep the ARM art, but the numbers drawn on them change;
- on SIDE3 the numbers are those of SIDE4, in COMIX, but the storage numbers
  start at their place instead of ending there.

A second mod folder, whose SIDE1 names an intgaf and a font the game data
lacks, starts and plays a skirmish on SIDE1, whose bars are drawn as those of
a fourth mod folder, whose SIDE1 names neither.

A third holds SIDEDATA, naming SIDEBINT for SIDE1, and SIDEBINT.GAF only in
gamedata-German and anims-German: a skirmish on SIDE1 in German draws
SIDEBINT's top bar, and one in English the installation's CORINT.
