"""Check that what is drawn never changes the game.

One seeded skirmish, two armies of sixty fighting from the first ticks, is
played headless many ways that change only what is drawn, when and how:

- drawn at 30 frames a second with the camera where the run puts it, at the
  map's top left corner (0,0) and far from the fight (3000,3000), and with
  its scroll swept over the fight;
- drawn at 60, 120 and 144 frames a second, and at 10, where most ticks are
  never drawn;
- drawn once after every tick without the match clock (no --frame-rate);
- drawn at zoom 0.5 and 4;
- drawn with enhanced anti-aliasing at 4x.

Every run must write the same trace stream, tick for tick, and every run that
ends on the same tick must reach the same world digest. The units aim at
where their targets' pieces are, which the game works out from the units
themselves, and the debris of explosions starts its particles in the game's
tick, so neither the camera nor the frames drawn can move the fight. The
director's drawn and undrawn replays are compared by native-director-view.
