"""Check that a stage plays out over its match and renders through a director script.

A headless skirmish is staged with units placed by map pixel and gathered
into groups, and lines timed for later ticks that place another unit, move
one group, send one on patrol, set one on the other's nearest units, switch
a radar tower off and on again with the ON/OFF button's orders, command one
to attack the ground and set one guarding another. The run must report
each line as its tick comes, the moved group must stand nearer its point
than where it was placed, a timed placement must hold the unit the trace
shows, and the radar must be on, then off, then on. A line
facing nowhere, an order to a group no unit joined, an "at" without an
action and an "activate" without a group must stop the run with the file
and line.

The same stage is then rendered by a director script that names it in place
of a recording, with encoding off and two stills: the render must write
both stills as PNG pictures of the script's size, the frames of every tick
and the manifest, and a second render must draw the same frames.
