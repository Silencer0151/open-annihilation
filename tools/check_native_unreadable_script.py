"""Check that a unit script the game cannot read stops neither its unit nor the load.

A unit whose script file is not a COB the game reads plays without a
script, as one whose script file is absent does: the match loads every unit
type, says once that the unit plays without a script, and plays on.

The game starts a headless skirmish twice, with --combat on the dummy SDL
drivers: once on the installation --game-dir names, and once with
--mod-dir naming a scratch mod folder that holds only a script for the Solar
Collector whose header puts its code past the end of the file. Both must end
with status 0 and load as many unit types; the second must say once that
ARMSOLAR plays without a script, and neither may report a simulation error.
