"""Count breaches of the engine's style rules per file, against a baseline that may only shrink.

The check reads every tracked C, C++ and Objective-C source (SOURCE_SUFFIXES)
under --root, leaving out the nested projects that build on the engine (a
directory whose CMakeLists.txt calls project() and takes OA_ENGINE_DIR) and
code kept as its authors wrote it (THIRD_PARTY_DIRECTORIES), and counts each
file's findings rule by rule. Rules:

  qualified-fixed-width  a fixed-width integer type written with std::
                         (write int32_t);
  name-offset            a name built from a record offset: field, flags,
                         value, byte, word, dword or offset joined to two or
                         more hex digits;
  name-address           a name that ends in six to eight hex digits, one of
                         them a digit, after an underscore;
  name-placeholder       a generated placeholder name: FUN, DAT, LAB or PTR,
                         an underscore and hex digits;
  name-unresolved        an unresolved name that carries its offset (unk and
                         0x);
  name-unknown           a placeholder name that numbers what it does not
                         know (unknown_3, a flag's UNKNOWN_BIT5, Unknown1,
                         unk_7): name the field, constant or bit by what it
                         holds; a value that means "not known at run time"
                         carries no number and is left alone;
  flags-raw-mask         a hex literal masked into, or with, a name that ends
                         in flags (&, |, ^, their assignments, ~): name the
                         bit;
  member-initializer     a scalar, enumeration or pointer member of a plain
                         struct without a {} or = initializer;
  offset-comment         a comment that gives a byte offset ('+0x' and hex
                         digits; '+' and two to five hex digits holding a
                         digit and a hex letter or a leading zero; 'offset'
                         and a hex number) outside the file-format
                         directories (FORMAT_DIRECTORIES): a record's
                         OA_ASSERT_OFFSET pins give its offsets, and a
                         comment names the field instead;
  doc-block              a function declared or defined in a header without
                         a /// line directly above its declaration; a
                         defaulted or deleted function (= default,
                         = delete), whose behaviour a block could only
                         restate, and the out-of-class definition of a
                         qualified name, documented where it is declared,
                         are left out;
  tier-virtual,          virtual, throw and the heap-allocating standard
  tier-throw,            containers (HEAP_CONTAINERS) in the directories of
  tier-heap-container    the core, base and simulation tiers (TIER_DIRECTORIES),
                         outside their tests;
  test-assert            a check made with assert(), or an #undef NDEBUG, in
                         a test: a file under a tests directory or named
                         <name>_test. A build that defines NDEBUG removes
                         assert(), and the test then passes whatever the
                         code does; check with OA_CHECK
                         (tests/support/include/oa/test/check.hpp) or the
                         module's own check macro.

The name rules read whole lines, comments and string literals included.
offset-comment reads comments only. The other rules read code, with comments
and the contents of string and character literals left out.

What counts as a plain struct: a struct (not a class or a union) outside a
union, in a C++ file (a .h, .c or .m file is C, where members take no
initializers), that declares no constructor and no virtual function. A
member counts when its type is a built-in arithmetic type, a fixed-width or
size type, an enumeration declared anywhere in the tree, an alias of one of
those declared with 'using', or any pointer. Bit-fields, references, static
members and members of local structs inside functions are not read.

Known limits: the checks are textual. A declaration that a macro builds is
not seen, a member whose type is an alias made with typedef does not count,
and a doc block that a preprocessor line separates from its declaration is
not directly above it. Enumerations and aliases are matched by their
unqualified name, so one declared in any namespace counts.

Baseline. The run compares its counts with a baseline of counts per file and
rule (--baseline FILE, by default tools/style-baseline.json under --root),
and fails unless every count equals the baseline's:

  - a count above the baseline, or a file or rule the baseline does not hold,
    is a new finding;
  - a count below the baseline, or a baseline entry for a file that is gone,
    is slack, which would let a new finding in where an old one was fixed.

Counting per file keeps a finding fixed in one file from making room for a
new one in another. --update records the counts that fell, removes the
entries of files that are gone and fails, writing nothing, while any count
grows; --accept-growth lets it record growth too, for a change that moves or
renames files, so that growth is a reviewed edit. --report prints the counts
per directory (the nearest directory holding a CMakeLists.txt, else the
file's first two path components); --list prints every finding, or those of
--rule.

Each finding prints as '<path>:<line>: <rule>: <text>'. Exit status is 1 when
a count differs from the baseline (or --update meets growth) and 2 when the
tree or the baseline cannot be read.
