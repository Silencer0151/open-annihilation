"""Generate the facts and tables of the standard hack and script extension pages from the registry.

Reads src/data/mod-profile/registry/hack-registry.yaml and keeps this
Markdown in step with it:

  docs/mods/standard-hacks/<hack id>.md
      one page per hack, whose first line, its heading, is the hack's title.
      A missing page is created as a skeleton: the title, the facts block, the headings Description, Configuration
      example and Details with a placeholder each for the prose, and the
      heading Full configuration schema with the schema block. The facts block
      gives the hack's id, its area, scope, the machines that run it, its number of
      parameters and whether the engine implements it; the schema block gives
      how a profile switches it on, every parameter with its type, unit,
      allowed values, list length, 3.1c baseline, default, who may adjust it,
      scope and the data key that overrides it, the presets, the constraints,
      the data keys that need the hack on, and a YAML block with every
      parameter at its default.
  docs/mods/script-extensions/<extension id>.md
      one page per script extension, headed by its title. A missing page is
      created as a skeleton: the title, the facts block, the headings
      Description, Syntax, Usage, Configuration example, Details and Related
      with a placeholder each for the prose, and the related block under
      Related. The facts block gives the extension's id, the profile block
      that mounts it, its usual index, its argument, what it returns, its
      scope, the machines that run it, whether every machine reads the same
      answer, and how the profile's fidelity changes it; the related block
      links the standard and every other extension's page.
  docs/mods/README.md
      the standard hacks table: one row per hack, grouped by area, with its
      title linking to its page, its id, one sentence on what it does, its
      scope and its status. Areas and the hacks within each follow their
      titles alphabetically, as Developer Mode lists them. Then the script
      extensions table: one row per extension, in the order of their usual
      indices, with its title linking to its page, its id, its usual index,
      its argument and what it returns. A missing file is created holding a
      title and both tables.
  docs/mods/oamod-standard.md
      the table of every script extension in section 7.2: its id linking to
      its page, its usual index, its argument and what it returns. A missing
      file is created holding a title and the table.

The titles of the hacks and their areas are the registry's (title and
area-titles); the titles of the script extensions and what each returns are
SCRIPT_EXTENSIONS', since the registry gives an extension no title. Besides a
page's heading, only the text between a '<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: name -->' line
and its '<!-- END GENERATED: name -->' line is written; everything else on a
page is prose and stays as it is. A page, README or standard that has lost a
block's markers or its heading is an error, as is a hack with no sentence in
SENTENCES (the registry's summaries are notes for the engine's developers; the
table says in one sentence what each hack does for a player), a script
extension with no entry in SCRIPT_EXTENSIONS, an entry there that names no
script extension in the registry, and a set extension, which the pages and
tables do not describe yet. A page in docs/mods/standard-hacks that
names no hack, or in docs/mods/script-extensions that names no script
extension, is reported as stale.

  gen_mod_docs.py              write the pages and the tables
  gen_mod_docs.py --check      write nothing; exit 1 when a block or page differs or is stale
  gen_mod_docs.py --self-test  check the tool itself on a small registry
