"""Add SPDX copyright and licence headers to the engine's files, or check that every file has its terms.

Every file the engine owns (tools/engine_files.py: the files Git tracks,
and new ones it does not ignore, less the nested projects and third-party
directories) states who holds its copyright and under which licence it is
distributed, in one of three ways. A file's copyright line names the
project's authors and points to COPYRIGHT_FILE at the tree's root, which says
who they are, so that the holder is stated once per repository rather than
in every file:

  - a header of its own: two comment lines in the style of its language at
    the top of the file (after a '#!' line, a Python coding line or a
    Dockerfile parser directive, which must come first), the SPDX
    FileCopyrightText tag with COPYRIGHT_TEXT and the SPDX
    License-Identifier tag with LICENCE_EXPRESSION (header_lines writes
    them);
  - an annotation in the root REUSE.toml, for a file that cannot carry a
    header (an image, JSON, data, the documents);
  - being a licence text or a third-party notice, which states its own terms:
    a file named LICENSE, LICENCE or COPYING (with any '.' or '-' suffix),
    or anything under a root licenses/ or LICENSES/ directory.

A run adds the header to each file that has none and can hold one: a file
whose comment style its name gives (COMMENT_BY_NAME, COMMENT_BY_SUFFIX, or a
'#!' line). Only a file that cannot hold one counts through REUSE.toml; one
that has neither a style nor an annotation is reported. A second run changes
nothing. --check changes nothing and fails when the root holds no
COPYRIGHT_FILE, when a file states no terms, when it holds only one of the
two SPDX lines, when its header names another licence than
LICENCE_EXPRESSION or another copyright than COPYRIGHT_TEXT (unless
OTHER_TERMS lists it), when REUSE.toml cannot be
read, when one of its paths without a wildcard names no file (stale after a
move; a pattern with one is a rule for files to come) or when a path
matches a file of a nested project, whose terms are its own.

REUSE.toml follows the REUSE specification's format (version 1): each
[[annotations]] table has 'path' (a pattern or a list of them, relative to
the root: '*' matches within one directory, '**' across directories, and
'\\' escapes the next character), 'SPDX-FileCopyrightText' and
'SPDX-License-Identifier'.

Exit status: 0 when every file states its terms (or, without --check, now
does); 1 when a file does not and cannot be given a header, or --check
finds a problem; 2 when the tree cannot be read, or Python is older than
3.11 (MIN_PYTHON), which the tool needs to read REUSE.toml.
